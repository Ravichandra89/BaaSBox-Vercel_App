# BaaSBox - Backend as a Service Platform

## Objective

BaaSBox is a Backend as a Service (BaaS) platform designed to simplify backend infrastructure management for developers. By integrating AWS resources like authentication, database management, and deployment pipelines, BaaSBox aims to streamline backend operations, enhancing developer productivity and accelerating application development. I am going to create a platform similar to Vercel, where users can deploy their MERN websites on AWS with S3 support in one click by providing their GitHub repository link.

# Application Deployment System - System Design

This document outlines the process of deploying and managing the application in three phases: GitHub Code Upload Phase, Deployment Phase, and Request Phase.

## 1. GitHub Code Upload Phase

In this phase, the system takes the link to the GitHub repository provided by the user and retrieves the code. The code is then stored on AWS S3 for backup purposes. Additionally, the production build is stored on the Amazon SQS service.

### Steps:

1. **Receive GitHub Repository Link**: Get the link from the user.
2. **Fetch Code**: Use the provided link to fetch the source code.
3. **Store on AWS S3**: Save a copy of the source code on AWS S3 for backup.
4. **Store Production Build on SQS**: Save the production build (HTML, CSS, JavaScript files) on the Amazon SQS service.

## 2. Deployment Phase

In this phase, the code is built and deployed. The system converts React files into browser-compatible files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and deploys them on Amazon EC2 instances. Deployment tasks are pulled from the Amazon SQS queue to automate the process.

### Steps:

1. **Build Production Server**: Convert React files into browser-compatible files.
2. **Pull Deployments from SQS**: Retrieve deployment tasks from the Amazon SQS queue.
3. **Deploy on EC2 Instances**: Automatically deploy the production build on Amazon EC2 instances. Utilize EC2 with Auto Scaling and AWS Fargate for efficient deployment and scaling.

## 3. Request Phase

In this phase, the system handles user requests based on their geographical location and serves the appropriate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript build files from AWS S3.

### Steps:

1. **Receive User Request**: Get the request from the user, including their geographical location and user ID.
2. **Determine Geographical Area**: Identify the user's geographical area.
3. **Serve Build Files**: Serve the corresponding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from AWS S3 based on the user ID and geographical area.

## Summary

## This deployment system is designed to efficiently manage code uploads, automate deployment, and handle user requests based on geographical location. By leveraging AWS services like S3, SQS, EC2, and Fargate, the system ensures scalability, reliability, and quick response times.
